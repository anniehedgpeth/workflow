# To Make a New Cookbook
 - Create a new repo in Github and copy the link
 - From the terminal, navigate to the cookbooks directory in my chef_repo directory and run
 `git clone <link>`
 - Now run `chef generate cookbook <COOKBOOK_PATH/COOKBOOK_NAME> (options)` from the directory that you want to parent your cookbook


# Before Uploading Policy to Chef Server...

## Code changes for hardening cookbook
 - adding / editing cookbook files
 - adding / editing InSpec profiles

## Make sure everything passes
 - Converge all resources successfully.
 - All tests pass.

## Update version in metatdata.rb

## Commit and Push to Github
Here's a good link for [branching and committing](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches).

# Now put this version into production
 - go to Chef workflow #2 on "Install and upload policy to Chef server" to deploy

***********************

Any time I change the cookbook, from that cookbookâ€™s directory, I need to:
bump the version in `metadata.rb`
 - (you would normally automate that in Jenkins)
`berks install`
`berks upload`

# To bootstrap a new machine:

`knife bootstrap chefkata3.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com -N chefkata3 -r 'recipe[chefkata::default], recipe[ubuntu14-hardening::default]' --ssh-user annie --sudo`

# To converge on that node from here on out:

run `sudo chef-client` in an ssh session

# To add run-list:

`knife node run_list set chefkata2 'recipe[chefkata::default]'`

# To edit the run-list:

 - make sure the cookbook is uploaded
 - make sure it has a `Berksfile`
 - `berks install`
 - `berks upload`
 - `knife node run_list add chefkata2 'ubuntu-14-hardening'`

# When adding an organization to manage.chef.io
 - add the org
 - reset user key
generate knife config from UI
copy the user key into .chef folder
create a new org key and download knife.rb
see if your user needs a new key
`knife node list`
