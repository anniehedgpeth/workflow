# LOCAL COOKBOOK DEVELOPMENT BADGE TOPICS

The Local Cookbook Development badge is awarded when someone proves that they understand the process of developing cookbooks locally. Candidates must show:

- An understanding of authoring cookbooks and setting up the local environment.
- An understanding of the Chef DK tools.
- An understanding of Test Kitchen configuration.
- An understanding of the available testing frameworks.
- An understanding of troubleshooting cookbooks.
- An understanding of search and databags.

_Here is a detailed breakdown of each area._

# COOKBOOK AUTHORING AND SETUP THEORY

## REPO STRUCTURE - MONOLITHIC VS SINGLE COOKBOOK

_Candidates should understand:_

### The pros and cons of a single repository per cookbook

 - _Cookbooks should not reside in the Chef Repo but rather be pulled in via dependency management tools like Berkshelf. Each cookbook should have its own Git repository, build process, and test suite. Cookbooks should be treated as software projects of their own. The suggested structure is to completely remove the idea of putting Cookbooks in your Chef Repo all together. Every cookbook would be contained within its own Git repository and every cookbook has its own Berksfile._

 - From there they suggest creating a build job on a CI server for every cookbook. This job would test and then upload the cookbook it is managing to your Chef Server.

**Pros -**
 - Each cookbook can be tested, uploaded, and verified by a build server 
 - Change management is simpler 
   - pinning versions to environments is straightforward
   - there can be an open source mentality toward changes to the cookbook
   - the run-list will only allow for one cookbook of that name per organization otherwise confusion abounds
 - You can use the "monolithic" chef-repo pattern as a "management console".
 - A different Berksfile per cookbook means that each cookbook can have different dependencies. So if cookbook A depends on apache v 2.0.0 and cookbook B depends on apache v 2.2.2, B's dependencies don't cancel out A's.

**Cons -**
 - The cookbook is shared with other applications, so a change might cause issues.
   - you may or may not be the maintainer of that cookbook which means you may not have rights to change it on the master branch
   - you may need a wrapper cookbook to extend the functionality of that cookbook

### [The pros and cons of an application repository](https://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/rfc019-chef-workflows.html)
**Pros -**
 - Everything needed for your application is in one place so it lessens confusion.
 - `chef vendor dependencies` does what berks would do to install cookbook dependencies.
 - You can test all your cookbooks together.

**Cons -**
Everything needed for your application must be the same version, creating ownership and change management issues. 

### How the Chef workflow supports monolithic vs single cookbooks
 - Monolithic: All of your Chef related source code, including any 3rd party dependencies, are tracked in one source control repository using Git. External dependencies, and any local modifications to them, are made with built-in vendor branches, allowing you to easily track the upstream for modifications.

 - Single: All of the Chef cookbooks are treated as independent software projects, that can be built in isolation from any other cookbook. External dependencies are fetched as-needed, and treated as artifacts. Changes to the upstream creates a new software projects, and is tracked as such.

### How to create a repository/workspace on the workstation
 - You can either run `chef generate repo [name]` or download a starter kit from the Chef server for your organization.

## VERSIONING OF COOKBOOKS
_Candidates should understand:_

### Why cookbooks should be versioned
 - Cookbooks need versions for running different cookbooks on their different environments.

### The recommended methods of maintaining versions (e.g. knife spork)
 - `knife spork bump alohaupdate` will automatically update the version number in your metadata if you don't manually change it in the `metadata.rb`.

### How to avoid overwriting cookbooks
 - by Freezing it with the `knife cookbook upload alohaupdate --freeze` or `berks upload` which freezes

### Where to define a cookbook version
 - in `metadata.rb`

### Semantic versioning
 - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or `BreakingChanges.BackwardsCompatibleChanges.BackwardsCompatibleBugFixes`
   - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
   - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
   - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

### [Freezing cookbooks](https://docs.chef.io/cookbook_versions.html#freeze-versions)
 - A cookbook version can be frozen, which will prevent updates from being made to that version of a cookbook. (A user can always upload a new version of a cookbook.) Using cookbook versions that are frozen within environments is a reliable way to keep a production environment safe from accidental updates while testing changes that are made to a development infrastructure.

### Re-uploading and freezing cookbooks
 - To freeze a cookbook version using knife, enter: `knife cookbook upload redis --freeze`
 - Once a cookbook version is frozen, only by using the --force option can an update be made. `knife cookbook upload redis --force`

## STRUCTURING COOKBOOK CONTENT
_Candidates should understand:_

### Modular content/reusability

### Best practices around cookbooks that map 1:1 to a piece of software or functionality vs monolithic cookbooks
 - 1:1 cookbooks are preferred as each piece of software needs to be managed separately within its own git repo.
   - Versioning - you can tag specific releases 
   - Hands in the pot - you can easily give everyone clone access, but restrict push access to select teams for certain repos 
   - History - if you need to history for a certain cookbook, you shouldn't have to run a complex git command to parse the logs 
   - Monolithic things are generally anti-patterns

### How to use common, core resources
 - (This is accomplished with the [chefkata](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chefkata).)
 - `:nothing` is the only action that can be used with any resource.
 - `file` `cookbook_file` `remote_file` `template` actions: 
   - `:create` `:create_if_missing` `:delete` `:nothing` `:touch`
 - Properties common to every resource include:
   - `ignore_failure` `provider` `retries` `retry_delay` `sensitive` `supports`
 - `execute` actions: `:nothing` `:run`
 - Common `execute` properties: `command` `notifies` `creates` (Prevent a command from creating a file when that file already exists.) `path` `returns`

```ruby
cookbook_file '/var/www/customers/public_html/index.php' do
  source 'index.php'
  owner 'web_admin'
  group 'web_admin'
  mode '0755'
  action :create
end
```

## HOW METADATA IS USED
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to manage dependencies
 - If you're using Berks, you would add `depends 'cookbook', 'version'` in the `metadata.rb`, and in the `Berksfile` you would add the `source`, such as the supermarket at `'https://supermarket.chef.io'`. 
 - If you're not using Berks, then you would add the dependencies to the `metadata.rb` in the same way, but you would run `knife upload `knife deps nodes/*.json` to use the output of knife deps to pass command to knife upload.

### Cookbook dependency version syntax
 - Inside of `metadata.rb` put `depends '<cookbook>'` or for a version constraint, `depends '<cookbook>', '> 2.0'`
   - The operators are `=, >=, >, <, <=, and ~>`. That last operator `~>` will go up to the next biggest version.

### What information to include in a cookbook - author, license, etc
**Metadata settings**

```ruby
name 'chefkata'
maintainer 'Annie Hedgpeth'
maintainer_email 'annie.hedgpeth@gmail.com'
license 'all_rights'
description 'Installs/Configures chefkata'
long_description 'Installs/Configures chefkata'
version '0.1.0'
issues_url 'https://github.com/<insert_org_here>/chefkata/issues' if respond_to?(:issues_url)
source_url 'https://github.com/<insert_org_here>/chefkata' if respond_to?(:source_url)
```

### What 'suggests' in metadata means
 - Same thing as depends, but that you suggest a cookbook be there. The cookbook will still run if that dependency doesn't exist.

### What 'issues_url' in metadata means
 - The `issues_url` points to the location where issues for this cookbook are tracked.  A `View Issues` link will be displayed on this cookbook's page when uploaded to a Supermarket.
 - The `source_url` points to the development repository for this cookbook.  A `View Source` link will be displayed on this cookbook's page when uploaded to a Supermarket.


## WRAPPER COOKBOOK METHODS
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to consume other cookbooks in code via wrapper cookbooks
 - You would add those cookbooks as dependencies in the metadata and then consume them by either:
   - `include_recipe` in the recipe and set the attributes in the attributes file (i.e. chef-client cookbook with a lot of recipes)
   - use the resources provided by the cookbook (i.e. Tomcat cookbook with lots of resources and no recipes)

### How to change cookbook behavior via wrapper cookbooks
 - You would add those cookbooks as dependencies in the metadata and then consume them by either:
   - `include_recipe` in the recipe and set the attributes in the attributes file (i.e. chef-client cookbook with a lot of recipes)
   - use the resources provided by the cookbook (i.e. Tomcat cookbook with lots of resources and no recipes)
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Set the attributes of the cookbook with `node.default['attribute'] = 'overridden_value'` and use `include_recipe`

### Attribute value precedence
 - OHAI will trump all other attributes. Then `override` will trump other attributes in the order of role, environment, node,/recipe, attribute files. Then the default attributes in that same order.
 - OHAI >> Normal (R, E, N, A) >> default (R, E, N, A)
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) [later overrides earlier](https://docs.chef.io/attributes.html):
   - Attribute -> Recipe -> Environment -> Role
   - Default -> Normal -> Override -> OHAI

  - declared in:
    - attribute: `default['attribute'] = value`, `normal['attribute'] = value`, `override['attribute'] = value`
    - cookbook: `node.default['attribute'] = value`, `node.normal['attribute'] = value`, `node.override['attribute'] = value`
    - environment: `default_attributes({ 'attribute' => 'value'})`, `override_attributes({'attribute' => 'value'})`
    - role: `default_attributes({ 'attribute' => 'value'})`, `override_attributes({'attribute' => 'value'})`

### How to use the `include_recipe` directive**
 - Add the recipe to your metadata.rb file, then use the `include_recipe` resource to run that entire recipe within the recipe in which you're including it.
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) add `depends 'cookbook_name'` to `metadata.rb` and then add `include_recipe 'cookbook_name::recipe_name'` to a recipe in your runlist

### What happens if the same recipe is included multiple times
 - If the `include_recipe` method is used more than once to include a recipe, only the first inclusion is processed and any subsequent inclusions are ignored.
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Only the first inclusion is processed and any subsequent inclusions are ignored.

### How to use the `depends` directive
 - If you need a cookbook as a dependency, then you would include `depends '<cookbook>' '<version>'` in the metadata of the wrapper / main cookbook.

## USING COMMUNITY COOKBOOKS
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to use a public and private Supermarket
 - Private Supermarket -
   - Create a server to serve as your private supermarket which hosts your cookbooks
   - add the URL of that server as your source to the private supermarket to your Berksfile so that it can look there for the dependent cookbooks and also add it to the knife.rb to upload cookbooks.
   - add all dependencies in the metadata.rb with `depends '<cookbook>' '<version>'`
   - use `knife cookbook site share COOKBOOK_NAME CATEGORY (options)` to upload cookbooks to the supermarket

 - Public Supermarket - 
   - add the public supermarket link as your source in the Berksfile
   - add all dependencies in the metadata.rb with `depends '<cookbook>' '<version>'`
   - you may only update a cookbook in the public supermarket if you are the owner/maintainer
   - anyone can upload a cookbook to the public supermarket

### How to use community cookbooks
 - You can either use it from the Supermarket, in which you'd depend on it in metadata, or you can clone it from version control and upload it to the Chef server with berks.

### How to wrap community cookbooks
 - You would add those cookbooks as dependencies in the metadata and then consume them by either:
    - `include_recipe` in the recipe and set the attributes in the attributes file (i.e. chef-client cookbook with a lot of recipes)
    - use the resources provided by the cookbook (i.e. Tomcat cookbook with lots of resources and no recipes)

### How to fork community cookbooks
 - Fork it to your own repo in git and assume the responsibility to maintain that cookbook from your own repo

### How to use Berkshelf to download cookbooks
 - run `berks install` with a valid `Berksfile` containing the source for the dependencies

### How to configure a Berksfile
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) `source` should point to a supermarket (and the first one gets precedence, so you could use a private then public supermarket)
   - Always include a `metadata` line to get all the `depends` attributes from the `metadata.rb`.
   - If your cookbook comes from another location than the supermarket, specify it, as in: `cookbook "<cookbook>", git: "http://github.com/username/repo'"`

### How to use a Berksfile to manage a community cookbook and a local cookbook with the same name
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) By using a private supermarket or specifying the exact location of that cookbook on your private git server, thus making it ignore the supermarket as a default source

## USING CHEF RESOURCES VS ARBITRARY COMMANDS
_Candidates should understand:_

### [How to shell out to run commands](https://docs.chef.io/dsl_recipe.html#shell-out)
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Use the `shell_out` (when errors don't matter) or `shell_out!` (raises error when command fails)
 - The `shell_out` method can be used to run a command against the node, and then display the output to the console when the log level is set to debug.
   - `shell_out(command_args)` where command_args is the command that is run against the node
 - The `shell_out!` method can be used to run a command against the node, display the output to the console when the log level is set to debug, and then raise an error when the method returns false.
   - `shell_out!(command_args)` where command_args is the command that is run against the node. This method will return true or false.
 - The `shell_out_with_systems_locale` method can be used to run a command against the node (via the `shell_out` method), but using the LC_ALL environment variable.
   - `shell_out_with_systems_locale(command_args)` where command_args is the command that is run against the node.

### When/not to shell out
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) As read-only, not to change state

### How to use the `execute` resource
 - `execute '/usr/sbin/apachectl configtest'`

### When/not to use the `execute` resource
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) When you are changing the state of the system

### How to ensure idempotence
 - by using guard clauses
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) By using notifies or the `not_if`/`only_if` clauses

# CHEF DK TOOLS

## `CHEF` COMMAND
_Candidates should understand:_

### What the `chef` command does
 - The `chef` command is used for generation and is like the `knife` command. You'd use it in place of `knife` when you use `policyfiles`.

 - `chef command [arguments...] [options...]`

```

```

### [How to customize content using `generators`](https://blog.chef.io/2014/12/09/guest-post-creating-your-own-chef-cookbook-generator/)
 - `chef generate cookbook my_cookbook_name -g ~/chef/pan`
  - This is a way that you can templatize the way in which you create a chef repo with settings specific to your organization.

### The recommended way to create a template
 - `chef generate template <templatename>`

### How to add the same boilerplate text to every recipe created by a team
 - According to [this](https://medium.com/@echohack/creating-your-own-chef-cookbook-generator-5e998db1255b), you'd add it to the `code_generator` at `/opt/chefdk/embedded/apps/chef-dk/lib/chef-dk/skeletons/code_generator`.

### The ['chef gem'](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-gem) command
 - The chef gem subcommand is a wrapper around the gem command in RubyGems and is used by Chef to install RubyGems into the Chef development kit development environment. All knife plugins, drivers for Kitchen, and other Ruby applications that are not packaged within the Chef development kit will be installed to the .chefdk path in the home directory: ~/.chefdk/gem/ruby/ver.si.on/bin (where ver.si.on is the version of Ruby that is packaged within the Chef development kit).

## [FOODCRITIC](https://docs.chef.io/foodcritic.html)
_Candidates should understand:_

### What Foodcritic is
 - Chef-specific linting of cookbooks
 - Use Foodcritic to check cookbooks for common problems:
   - Style
   - Correctness
   - Syntax
   - Best practices
   - Common mistakes
   - Deprecations

### Why developers should lint their code
 - Consistency

### Foodcritic errors and how to fix them
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) They all start with `FC001`; you can google that to get to the exact rule.

### Community coding rules & custom rules

### Foodcritic commands
 - `foodcritic /path/to/cookbook`
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Just run `foodcritic .` to do a scan from the cookbook folder. Add `--epic-fail` to make it fail when foodcritic fails.
 - A Foodcritic evaluation has the following syntax: `RULENUMBER: MESSAGE: FILEPATH:LINENUMBER`

### [Foodcritic rules](http://www.foodcritic.io/)
 - It comes with 60 built-in rules that identify problems ranging from simple style inconsistencies to difficult to diagnose issues that will hurt in production. 
 - Various nice people in the Chef community have also written extra rules for foodcritic that you can install and run. Or write your own!
   - [Custom Customink Rules](https://github.com/customink-webops/foodcritic-rules/blob/master/rules.rb)
   - [Custom Etsy Rules](https://github.com/etsy/foodcritic-rules)

### How to exclude Foodcritic rules
 - `foodcritic . --tags ~RULE`
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) For the entire cookbook, add `FC###` to the `.foodcritic` file in the root of the cookbook folder
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) For single line of code, add the comment at the end of the line: `# ~FC003`

## BERKS
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to use berks to work with upstream dependencies
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) by using the supermarket for dependencies, or by doing version pinning

### How to work with GitHub & Supermarket
 -  [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) in the `Berksfile` you can state the `git:` location or have another supermarket listed as your `source:` (or even multiple ones if you want public to be a backup)

### How to work with dependent cookbooks
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Most of the time it works with `metadata.rb` inclusion, but you can extend it with the `cookbook` line (by including further version pinning and overriding location).

### How to troubleshoot berks issues


### How to lock cookbook versions
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) cookbooks are frozen by default with a `berks upload`

### How to manage dependencies using berks
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) berks commands
   - `berks install` loads dependencies locally
   - `berks upload` uploads dependencies to chef server
   - `berks info <cookbook>` will display information for that cookbook
   - `berks list` will list cookbooks and their dependencies
   - `berks apply production Berksfile.lock` will apply the settings in berksfile to the provided environment

## [RUBOCOP](https://docs.chef.io/rubocop.html)
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to use RuboCop to check Ruby styles
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) `rubocop .` command from the cookbook folder

### RuboCop vs Foodcritic
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) Rubocop is for ruby style, Foodcritic is for chef specifid linting
 - Use RuboCop to author better Ruby code:
   - Enforce style conventions and best practices
   - Evaluate the code in a cookbook against metrics like “line length” and “function size”
   - Help every member of a team to author similary structured code
   - Establish uniformity of source code
   - Set expectations for fellow (and future) project contributors

### RuboCop configuration & commands
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) `--fail-fast` a good option for CI

### Auto correction
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) `-a` or `--auto-correct` to auto-correct offenses

### How to be selective about the rules you run
 - Each cookbook has its own `.rubocop.yml` file, which means that each cookbook may have its own set of enabled, disabled, and custom rules. That said, it’s more common for all cookbooks to have the same set of enabled, disabled, and custom rules. When RuboCop is run against a cookbook, the full set of enabled and disabled rules (as defined the `enabled.yml` and `disabled.yml` files in RuboCop itself) are loaded first, and are then compared against the settings in the cookbook’s `.rubocop.yml` file.

```ruby
NAME_OF_RULE:
  Description: 'a description of a rule'
  Enabled : (true or false)
  KEY: VALUE
```
 - Use a `.rubocop_todo.yml` file to capture the current state of all evaluations, and then write them to a file. This allows evaluations to reviewed one at a time. Disable any evaluations that are unhelpful, and then address the ones that are.
 - To generate the `.rubocop_todo.yml` file, run the following command: `rubocop --auto-gen-config`
   - Rename this file to `.rubocop.yml` to adopt this evaluation state as the standard. 
   - Include this file in the `.rubocop.yml` file by adding `inherit_from: .rubocop_todo.yml` to the top of the `.rubocop.yml` file.


## TEST KITCHEN
_Candidates should understand:_

### Writing tests to verify intent
 - One should use InSpec to write tests that verify that the desired state was achieved, not necessarily that all of the resources simply converged but that they're functioning in the desired state.

### How to focus tests on critical outcomes
 - One should use InSpec to write tests that verify that the desired state was achieved, not necessarily that all of the resources simply converged but that they're functioning in the desired state.

### How to test each resource component vs how to test for desired outcomes
 - One should use InSpec to write tests that verify that the desired state was achieved, not necessarily that all of the resources simply converged but that they're functioning in the desired state.

### Regression testing
 - Running `kitchen converge` twice will ensure your policy applies without error to existing instances
 - Running `kitchen test` will ensure your policy applies without error to any new instances

# TEST KITCHEN 

 - The basic structure of a .kitchen.yml file is as follows:

```yaml
driver:
  name: driver_name

provisioner:
  name: provisioner_name

verifier:
  name: verifier_name

transport:
  name: transport_name

platforms:
  - name: platform-version
    driver:
      name: driver_name
  - name: platform-version

suites:
  - name: suite_name
    run_list:
      - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]
    attributes: { foo: "bar" }
    excludes:
      - platform-version
  - name: suite_name
    driver:
      name: driver_name
    run_list:
      - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]
    attributes: { foo: "bar" }
    includes:
      - platform-version
```

## DRIVERS
_Candidates should understand:_

### Test Kitchen provider & platform support
 - `platforms:` contains a list of all the platforms that Kitchen will test against when executed. This should be a list of all the platforms that you want your cookbook to support.

### How to use .kitchen.yml to set up complex testing matrices
 - In the `.kitchen.yml` file we define two fields that create a test matrix; the number of **platforms** we want to support multiplied by the number of test **suites** that we defined.

### How to test a cookbook on multiple deployment scenarios
 - In the `.kitchen.yml` file we define two fields that create a test matrix; the number of **platforms** we want to support multiplied by the number of test **suites** that we defined.

### How to configure drivers
 - Kitchen uses a driver plugin architecture to enable Kitchen to simulate testing on cloud providers, such as Amazon EC2, OpenStack, and Rackspace, and also on non-cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Windows. Each driver is responsible for managing a virtual instance of that platform so that it may be used by Kitchen during cookbook testing.
   - Most drivers have driver-specific configuration settings that must be added to the `.kitchen.yml` file before Kitchen will be able to use that platform during cookbook testing. For information about these driver-specific settings, refer to the driver-specific documentation.
   - Common drivers include: 
     - `kitchen-all`   A driver for everything, or “all the drivers in a single Ruby gem”.
     - `kitchen-bluebox` A driver for Blue Box.
     - `kitchen-cloudstack` A driver for CloudStack.
     - `kitchen-digitalocean` A driver for DigitalOcean.
     - `kitchen-docker` A driver for Docker.
     - `kitchen-dsc` A driver for Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC).
     - `kitchen-ec2` A driver for Amazon EC2.
     - `kitchen-fog` A driver for Fog, a Ruby gem for interacting with various cloud providers.
     - `kitchen-google` A driver for Google Compute Engine.
     - `kitchen-hyperv` A driver for Hyper-V Server.
     - `kitchen-joyent` A driver for Joyent.
     - `kitchen-linode` A driver for Linode.
     - `kitchen-opennebula` A driver for OpenNebula.
     - `kitchen-openstack` A driver for OpenStack.
     - `kitchen-pester` A driver for Pester, a testing framework for Microsoft Windows.
     - `kitchen-rackspace` A driver for Rackspace.
     - `kitchen-vagrant` A driver for Vagrant. The default driver packaged with the Chef development kit.

## PROVISIONER
_Candidates should understand:_

### The available provisioners
 - `chef_zero` and `chef_solo` are the most common provisioners used for testing cookbooks.

### How to configure provisioners

```yaml
provisioner:
  name: chef_zero
  http_proxy: http://10.0.0.1
```
 - The environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `ftp_proxy` are honored by Kitchen for proxies. The `client.rb` file is read to look for proxy configuration settings. If `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `ftp_proxy` are specified in the `client.rb` file, the `chef-client` will configure the ENV variable based on these (and related) settings. 

```ruby
http_proxy 'http://proxy.example.org:8080'
http_proxy_user 'myself'
http_proxy_pass 'Password1'
```

 - `ENV['http_proxy'] = 'http://myself:Password1@proxy.example.org:8080'`
 - Kitchen also supports `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` in the `.kitchen.yml` file:

### When to use `chef-client` vs. `chef-solo` vs. `Chef`
 - `chef-client` to converge the node when it is bootstrapped to the Chef server.
 - `chef-solo` as the provisioner for Test Kitchen when you run a light-weight version of Chef on the VM being tested
 - `Chef` when you interact with the Chef server
 
### How to use the [shell provisioner](https://www.morethanseven.net/2014/01/12/shell-provisioner-for-test-kitchen/)  
 - to run a command during a converge
 - The shell provisioner is going to look for a file called `bootstrap.sh` by default.
   - In this case our script is completely self contained but if it needed some additional files we could put them in a directory called data and they would be copied to the newly created virtual machine under `/tmp/kitchen`.

## SUITES
_Candidates should understand:_

### What a suite is
 - a scenario that you want to run that consists of set of names for each of the platforms specified

```yaml
  - name: suite_name
    driver:
      name: driver_name
    run_list:
      - recipe[cookbook_name::recipe_name]
    attributes: { foo: "bar" }
    includes:
      - platform-version
```

 - including or excluding platforms is available 

```yaml
 driver:
   name: vagrant

 provisioner:
   name: chef_zero

 platforms:
   - name: ubuntu-12.04
   - name: centos-6.4
   - name: debian-7.1.0

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[apache::httpd]
    excludes:
      - debian-7.1.0
```

### How to use suites to test different recipes in different environments
 - Each suite is given a runlist. (see above)
 - Attributes are given for each suite.

### Testing directory for InSpec
 - The InSpec tests are to be stored in `<cookbook>/test/<integration-OR-recipes>/<suite-name>`
 - If your path is different, then you must specify as such in the `.kitchen.yml`.

```yaml
  verifier:
    inspec_tests:
      - test/foo/bar
```

### How to configure suites
 - Answered above
 - 1) edit their run lists, and 2) define a platform for the suite in the `platforms` setting

## PLATFORMS
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to specify platforms
 - Within the `suites:` you may include or exclude platforms that are listed in your `platforms:` section.

```yaml
    includes:
      - platform-version
```

### Common platforms
 - ubuntu, debian, windows, centos, rhel

### How to locate base images
 - [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) is a project that contains a set of base images that are used by Chef for internal testing and to provide a comprehensive set of base images for use with Kitchen. By default, Kitchen uses the base images provided by Bento. (Custom images may also be built using Packer.)
 - If you are using a vagrant image, you can go to the Atlas site to see the available [Bento boxes](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=bento).

### Common images and custom images
 - The common images are from [Bento](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=&q=bento).
 - If you want to make a custom image, then you would build it with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/build-image.html), then upload those files to Atlas.
 - You may also use images built by the community on the Atlas site. 

## KITCHEN COMMANDS
_Candidates should understand:_

### The basic Test Kitchen workflow
 - `kitchen create` to create the vm instance
 - `kitchen converge` to compile and converge the cookbooks on the vm instance
 - `kitchen verify` to run the InSpec tests on the instance
 - `kitchen destroy` to destroy the instance

### 'kitchen' commands
 - `kitchen create` to create the vm instance
 - `kitchen converge` to compile and converge the cookbooks on the vm instance
 - `kitchen verify` to run the InSpec tests on the instance
 - `kitchen destroy` to destroy the instance
 - `kitchen test` to destroy the instance if one exits followed by running through all of the above tests and finishing with another destroy
 - `kitchen login` to log into the vm instance
 - `kitchen init` to initialize a new `.kitchen.yml`

### When tests get run
 - when you run `kitchen verify`

### How to install [bussers](https://docs.chef.io/kitchen.html#busser) 
 - Busser is a test setup and execution framework that is designed to work on remote nodes whose system dependencies cannot be relied upon. 
   - Kitchen uses Busser to run post-convergence tests via a plugin architecture that supports different test frameworks. Busser is installed automatically as part of Kitchen.

### What 'kitchen init' does
 - `kitchen init` to initialize a new `.kitchen.yml`

# COOKBOOK COMPONENTS 

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF A COOKBOOK
_Candidates should understand:_

### What the components of a cookbook are
 - Directories are:
   - recipes
   - files
   - attributes
   - test
   - spec
   - libraries
   - templates
   - definitions (don't want to use it, but you should be aware of it)
   - resources
   - providers (only if the cookbook employs lwrp or hwrp)
 - Files are:
   - .kitchen.yml
   - Berksfile
   - metadata.rb
   - README.md
   - chefignore

### What siblings of cookbooks in a repository are
 - data_bags
 - roles
 - environments

### The default recipe & attributes files
 - The default recipe is the only one that is run when a cookbook called without a recipe specified.
 - An [attribute file](https://docs.chef.io/attributes.html) is located in the attributes/ sub-directory for a cookbook. 
   - When a cookbook is run against a node, the attributes contained in all attribute files are evaluated in the context of the node object. 
   - Node methods (when present) are used to set attribute values on a node.

### Why there is a 'default' subdirectory under 'templates’
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) It is the fallback of where to go for templates. Templates can also be platform specific, where the platform would be the directory. Or you can specify the group in the recipe code, which would be configurable

### Where tests are stored
 -  inspec: `tests/integration/default`
 -  serverspec: `spec` directory

## ATTRIBUTES AND HOW THEY WORK 
_Candidates should understand:_

### What attributes are
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) values defined in a file within the attributes directory

### Attributes as a nested hash
 - The following two blocks say the same thing. The second displays the attributes in a nested hash.

```ruby
default['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key1'] = 'value1'
default['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key2'] = 'value2'
default['cookbook_name']['different_category'] = 'other_value'
```

```ruby
default['cookbook_name'] = {
  category_name: {
    value1: 'value1',
    value2: 'value2'
  },
  different_category: 'other_value'
}
```

### How attributes are defined
 - Attributes are defined by:
   - Attributes file (can be `.json` or `.rb`)

```ruby
default['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key1'] = 'value1'
default['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key2'] = 'value2'
normal['cookbook_name']['different_category'] = 'other_value' # normal overrides the default value
```
   - In recipes - 

```ruby
node.default['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key1'] = 'recipe_value'
node.normal['cookbook_name']['category_name']['key2'] = 'recipe_value2'
```

   - Roles & Environments

```ruby
override_attributes({
  category_name: {
    value1: 'new_value1',
    value2: 'new_value2'
  }
})
default_attributes({
  category_name: {
    value1: 'new_value1-a',
    value2: 'new_value2-b'
  }
})
```

### How attributes are named
 - in a nested tree

### How attributes are referenced
 - `node[key:value]`

### Attribute precedence levels
 - OHAI >> Normal/Override (Role, Env, Node/recipe, Attribute) >> default (Role, Env, Node/recipe, Attribute)

### What [Ohai](https://docs.chef.io/ohai.html) is
 - Ohai is a tool that is used to detect attributes on a node, and then provide these attributes to the chef-client at the start of every chef-client run. Ohai is required by the chef-client and must be present on a node. (Ohai is installed on a node as part of the chef-client install process.)
 - Attributes that are collected by Ohai are automatic level attributes, in that these attributes are used by the chef-client to ensure that these attributes remain unchanged after the chef-client is done configuring the node.

### What the 'platform' attribute is
 - [Ohai](https://docs.chef.io/ohai.html) collects data for many platforms, including AIX, Darwin, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and any Microsoft Windows operating system based off the Windows_NT kernel and has access to win32 or win64 sub-systems.

### How to use the 'platform' attribute in [recipes](https://docs.chef.io/dsl_recipe.html)

```ruby
if node['platform'] == 'ubuntu'
  # do ubuntu things
end
```

## FILES AND TEMPLATES - DIFFERENCE AND HOW THEY WORK, WHEN TO USE EACH
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to instantiate [files](https://docs.chef.io/files.html) on nodes
 - Use the `cookbook_file` resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the /files directory in a cookbook.
 - Use the `file` resource to manage files directly on a node.
 - Use the `remote_file` resource to transfer files to nodes from remote locations.
 - Use the `template` resource to manage files that are added to nodes based on files that are located in the /templates directory in a cookbook.

### The difference between `file`, `cookbook_file`, `remote_file`, and `template`
   - `file` - Use this when you want to create a simple file. You'll use the `content` property to add the content. 
   - `cookbook_file` - Use this when you want to store a file in the cookbook to be copied directly onto the node.
   - `source` - Use this when you have a remote source on which the file is stored that you want put on the node.
   - `template` - Use this when you want to create a file out of a template based on environment variables.

### How two teams can manage the same file
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) If they can share the same cookbok, then by overriding attributes on the same cookbook. Otherwise use partial templates (see below).

### How to write templates
 - You would use the `template` resource in the recipe:

```ruby
template '/etc/motd' do
  source 'motd.erb'
  owner 'root'
  group 'root'
  mode '0755'
  variables({
    key: 'value'
  })
end
```
 - And the actual template would be the file name with its extension and an `.erb` extension. The file would look like:

```
message = <%= message %>
```

### What ['partial templates'](https://docs.chef.io/resource_template.html#partial-templates) are
 - A template can be built in a way that allows it to contain references to one (or more) smaller template files. 
 - These smaller template files are also referred to as partials.
 - A partial can be referenced from a template file in one of the following ways:
   - By using the render method in the template file
     - `<%= render "simple.txt.erb", :variables => {:user => Etc.getlogin }, :local => true %>`
   - By using the template resource and the variables property

### Common file-related resource actions and properties
 - `file` `cookbook_file` `remote_file` `template` actions: 
   - `:create` `:create_if_missing` `:delete` `:nothing` `:touch`
 - Properties common to every resource include:
   - `ignore_failure` `provider` `retries` `retry_delay` `sensitive` `supports`
- Common file-related resource properties:
   - `notifies` `mode` `group` `content` `owner` `subscribes`

### [ERB syntax](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.9/lang_template_erb.html)
 - Each ERB tag has a beginning tag and a matched ending tag. `<% code %>`
   - This executes the ruby code within the brackets and does not display the result. `<% if (50 + 50) == 100 %>`
   - We use `<%= code %>` when we want to show the value stored in a variable or the result of some calculation.
     - For example: `<%= node['hostname'] %>`

## CUSTOM RESOURCES - HOW THEY ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE THEY GO
_Candidates should understand:_

### What custom resources are
 - A custom resource can either be a hwrp, lwrp, a definition, or a custom resource.

### How to consume resources specified in another cookbook
 -   depend on cookbook, and then use them

### Naming conventions
 - If you do not explicitly name the custom resource then it will be named like `<cookbook>_<filename>`

### How to test custom resources
 - [MH:](https://github.com/mhedgpeth/mhedgpeth.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/local-cookbook-development-notes.md) by using a wrapper cookbook embedded inside of the cookbook (I usually put it in `test/cookbooks` and then included in the runlist)


## [LIBRARIES](https://docs.chef.io/libraries.html) 
_Candidates should understand:_

### What libraries are and when to use them
 - In the same way that the `resources` directory is where you'd store custom resources, you will store ruby code that you want to reuse in the `libraries` directory.
 - Use a library to:
   - Create a custom class or module; for example, create a subclass of Chef::Recipe
   - Connect to a database
   - Talk to an LDAP provider
   - Do anything that can be done with Ruby
 
### Where libraries are stored
 - A library file is a Ruby file that is located within a cookbook’s `/libraries` directory.

# AVAILALABLE TESTING FRAMEWORKS 

## INSPEC
_Candidates should understand:_

### How to test common resources with InSpec
 - see below

### InSpec syntax

```ruby
describe bash('command') do
  it { should exist }
  its('matcher') { should eq 'output' }
end

describe file('path') do
  it { should MATCHER 'value' }
end

describe http('url', auth: {user: 'user', pass: 'test'}, params: {params}, method: 'method', headers: {headers}, body: body) do
  its('status') { should eq number }
  its('body') { should eq 'body' }
  its('headers.name') { should eq 'header' }
end

describe os[:family] do
  it { should eq 'platform_name' }
end
```

### How to write InSpec tests
 - see above

### How to run InSpec tests
 - `inspec exec path/to/test`
 - After running the tests, you will receive feedback about what was retuned in regard to what was expected.

```ruby
describe some_resource('/proc/cpuinfo') do
  its('mode') { should cmp '0345' }
end

expected: 0345
got: 0444
```

### [Where InSpec tests are stored](http://www.anniehedgie.com/inspec-basics-6)
 - locally
 - Supermarket
 - git
 - Chef Compliance Server

## CHEFSPEC
Candidates should understand:

### What ChefSpec is
 - 

### The ChefSpec value proposition
 - The benefit of writing tests focused around the Resource Collection will allow us to gain feedback quickly and build a better development workflow.

### What happens when you run ChefSpec
 - it tests the resources compiled, not running those resources

### ChefSpec syntax

```ruby
describe 'scenario'
  context 'when something happens' do
    let :chef_run do
      runner = ChefSpec::SoloRunner.new(platform: 'windows', version: '2012R2')
      runner.converge(described_recipe)
    end

    it 'converges successfully' do
      expect { chef_run }.to_not raise_error
    end
  end
```

### How to write [ChefSpec tests](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html)

```ruby
# Recipe - file resource

file '/tmp/explicit_action' do
  action :delete
end

file '/tmp/with_attributes' do
  user 'user'
  group 'group'
  backup false
  action :delete
end

file 'specifying the identity attribute' do
  path   '/tmp/identity_attribute'
 action :delete
end
```

```ruby
# Unit Test
require 'chefspec'

describe 'file::delete' do
  let(:chef_run) { ChefSpec::SoloRunner.new(platform: 'ubuntu', version: '16.04').converge(described_recipe) }

  it 'deletes a file with an explicit action' do
    expect(chef_run).to delete_file('/tmp/explicit_action')
    expect(chef_run).to_not delete_file('/tmp/not_explicit_action')
  end

  it 'deletes a file with attributes' do
    expect(chef_run).to delete_file('/tmp/with_attributes').with(backup: false)
    expect(chef_run).to_not delete_file('/tmp/with_attributes').with(backup: true)
  end

  it 'deletes a file when specifying the identity attribute' do
    expect(chef_run).to delete_file('/tmp/identity_attribute')
  end
end
```
### How to run ChefSpec tests
 - `rspec` or `chef exec rspec`

### Where ChefSpec tests are stored
 - `spec/unit/recipes`

## GENERIC TESTING TOPICS
_Candidates should understand:_

### The test-driven development (TDD) workflow
 - Define a test set for the unit first
 - Then implement the unit
 - Finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.
 - Refactor

### Where tests are stored
 - Inspec: `<cookbook>/test/<integration-OR-recipes>/<suite-name>`
 - ChefSpec: `<cookbook>/spec/unit/recipes`

### How tests are organized in a cookbook
 - by suites

### Naming conventions - how Test Kitchen finds tests
 - The InSpec tests are to be stored in `<cookbook>/test/<integration-OR-recipes>/<suite-name>`
 - If your path is different, then you must specify as such in the .kitchen.yml.

```yaml
  verifier:
    inspec_tests:
      - test/foo/bar
```

### Tools to test code "at rest" 
 - Foodcritic and Rubocop

### Integration testing tools
 - InSpec

### Tools to run code and test the output
 - InSpec

### When to use ChefSpec in the workflow  
 - after linting and before Kitchen

### When to use Test Kitchen in the workflow
 - after ChefSpec and before promotion to the Chef server or Supermarket

### Testing intent
 - One should use InSpec to write tests that verify that the desired state was achieved, not necessarily that all of the resources simply converged but that they're functioning in the desired state.

### Functional vs unit testing
 - Functional is basically integration testing which you'd do with InSpec.
 - Unit testing would be done with ChefSpec.


# TROUBLESHOOTING 

## READING TEST-KITCHEN OUTPUT
_Candidates should understand:_

### Test Kitchen phases and associated output
 - `kitchen create` to create the vm instance
 - `kitchen converge` to compile and converge the cookbooks on the vm instance

## COMPILE VS. CONVERGE
_Candidates should understand:_

### What happens during the compile phase of a chef-client run
 - All of the code is run in order to get the resources ready for consumption.

### What happens during the converge phase of a chef-client run
 - All of the resources are executed on the node.

### When pure Ruby gets executed
 - This happens in the compile phase.

### When Chef code gets executed
 - This happens during the converge phase.
